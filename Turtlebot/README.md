# Turtlebot Teleoperation in Unity

Implement of Turtlebot Teleoperation in Unity Environment using URDF Importer, ROSâ€“Unity Integration from [Unity Robotics Hub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub).

Imported URDF files from [turtlebot_description](https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot/tree/melodic/turtlebot_description/urdf). Sending and receiving messages between ROS and Unity.


# How to Start
```
git clone https://github.com/kjwoo31/ROS_unity.git
```

## 1. ROS Setup
> Note: Tested with ROS Melodic, Ubuntu 18.04.
1. The provided files require the following packages to be installed. ROS Melodic users should run the following commands if the packages are not already present:

   ```
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
   sudo apt-get install python-pip ros-melodic-robot-state-publisher ros-melodic-moveit ros-melodic-rosbridge-suite ros-melodic-joy ros-melodic-ros-control ros-melodic-ros-controllers ros-melodic-tf2-web-republisher
   sudo -H pip install rospkg jsonpickle
   ```

2. Navigate to the `/PATH/TO/ROS_unity/Turtlebot/ROS` directory of this downloaded repo.
   - This directory will be used as the [ROS catkin workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/using_a_workspace).
   - built and source the ROS workspace

    ```
    cd /PATH/TO/ROS_unity/Turtlebot/ROS/
    catkin_make && source devel/setup.bash
    ```

3. The ROS parameters will need to be set to your configuration in order to allow the server endpoint to fetch values for the TCP connection, stored in `src/turtlebot_teleop/config/params.yaml`. From your ROS workspace, assign the ROS IP in this `yaml` file:

    ```bash
    echo "ROS_IP: $(hostname -I)" > src/turtlebot_teleop/config/params.yaml
    ```

    > Note: You can also manually assign this value by navigating to the `params.yaml` file and opening it for editing.

    ```yaml
    ROS_IP: <your ROS IP>
    ```

    e.g.

    ```yaml
    ROS_IP: 192.168.50.149
    ```

The ROS workspace is now ready to accept commands!

## 2. Unity Setup
1. Install [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).

1. Download 2020 version of Unity: This project is tested in **2020.3.11f1**.

1. Click the "Add" button in the top right of the "Projects" tab on Unity Hub, and navigate to and select the Turtlebot directory within this cloned repository (`/PATH/TO/ROS_unity/Turtlebot`) to add the tutorial project to your Hub.

1. Click the newly added project to open it.
   - Click 'ignore' if an error message appears. (This happens because we didn't import .msg file yet)

1. In Unity, double click to open the `Assets/Scenes/EmptyScene` scene if it is not already open.

1. Import .msg file from `Robotics -> ROS Message Browser` from the top menu bar. Browse turtlebot_teleop package and build TurtlebotTeleop.msg file.
   - If Unity Robotics packages doesn't appear, follow the directions from [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub/blob/main/tutorials/quick_setup.md).

1. Select `Robotics -> ROS Settings` from the top menu bar.
   - In the ROS Settings window, the `ROS IP Address` should be the IP address of your ROS machine (*not* the one running Unity).
   - Find the IP address of your ROS machine. In Ubuntu, open a terminal window, and enter `hostname -I`.

Now you are ready to communicate ROS and Unity.


## 3. Launch the file and click the Play button in Unity.

```
roslaunch turtlebot_teleop move.launch
```
    
- Use wasd or arrow keys to send message in Unity.

## How to activate in new terminal (after setup)

```
cd /PATH/TO/ROS_unity/Turtlebot/ROS/
catkin_make && source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch turtlebot_teleop move.launch
```
